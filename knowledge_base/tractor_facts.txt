--- Tractor Facts ---
- Model: A & B
- Power: Diesel engine, manual transmission.
- Battery: 12V, located under the driver’s seat or under the hood.
- Battery Terminals: Prone to white/green corrosion.
- Common Problem: Tractor won’t start, makes a “clicking” sound, or cranks slowly.
- Possible Cause: Weak battery, corroded terminals, or loose ground cable.
- Check: Clean terminals and ensure tight connections; charge or replace battery if needed.

- Starter Motor:
- Common Problem: Turning key produces no crank or very slow crank.
- Possible Cause: Faulty solenoid, worn brushes, or weak battery supply.
- Check: Tap starter gently, check for proper voltage supply at terminals.

- Alternator / Charging System:
- Common Problem: Battery keeps draining even after replacement.
- Possible Cause: Alternator belt is loose or alternator not charging.
- Check: Inspect belt tension, use a multimeter — should read 13.8–14.4V when running.

- Clutch: Linkage-based, mechanical.
- Location: Under the tractor, left side, behind the pedal.
- Adjustment: Performed with a 'lock nut' (13mm, back) and an 'adjusting nut' (front) on the linkage rod.
- Specification: Correct free play should be 20–30mm.
- Common Problem: Grinding gears, “slipping” (engine revs but tractor doesn’t move), or “stuck” pedal.
- Possible Cause: Incorrect free play, worn clutch plate, or broken return spring.
- Check: Adjust linkage; replace clutch disc if slipping persists.

- Transmission / Gearbox:
- Common Problem: Hard shifting or grinding when changing gears.
- Possible Cause: Clutch not disengaging fully, low transmission oil, or worn synchronizers.
- Check: Verify clutch adjustment, inspect oil level, and ensure oil is clean (not milky or dark).

- Cooling System: Water-cooled with radiator and fan.
- Common Problem: Engine overheating, black smoke, or “hot” smell.
- Possible Cause: Low coolant level, clogged radiator fins, or faulty fan belt.
- Check: Clean radiator fins, check coolant level and belt condition.

- Fuel System: Diesel injection with fuel filter and separator bowl.
- Common Problem: Engine sputters, loses power, or stops under load.
- Possible Cause: Clogged fuel filter, air in fuel line, or water in separator.
- Check: Drain separator, replace fuel filter, bleed air from the system.

- Air Filter:
- Common Problem: Tractor feels weak or emits black smoke.
- Possible Cause: Air filter clogged with dust or oil.
- Check: Remove and clean air filter; replace if saturated.

- Hydraulic System:
- Function: Operates 3-point hitch and other implements.
- Common Problem: Hitch will not lift, lifts slowly, or is jerky.
- Possible Cause: Low hydraulic fluid, clogged hydraulic filter, or air trapped in system.
- Check: Inspect fluid level (dipstick usually at rear), top up or replace with proper grade oil.

- Brake System:
- Common Problem: Brakes feel soft, uneven, or fail to stop tractor.
- Possible Cause: Low brake fluid (in oil-type brakes), worn brake shoes, or air in brake line.
- Check: Inspect brake fluid reservoir, bleed air, adjust pedal free play.

- Steering System:
- Type: Manual or Power steering (hydraulic assist).
- Common Problem: Steering feels heavy, jerky, or unresponsive.
- Possible Cause: Low power steering fluid, air in hydraulic lines, or worn steering pump.
- Check: Top up fluid and inspect for leaks around pump or cylinder.

- Tyres & Wheels:
- Common Problem: Tractor pulls to one side or feels unstable.
- Possible Cause: Uneven tyre pressure or worn tread.
- Check: Inflate to recommended PSI; inspect tyres for cracks or cuts.

- Electrical System:
- Common Problem: Headlights or indicators not working.
- Possible Cause: Blown fuse, faulty switch, or damaged wiring.
- Check: Replace fuse, clean connectors, inspect harness for wear.

- Exhaust / Emission:
- Common Problem: Excessive black smoke or misfiring sound.
- Possible Cause: Dirty air filter, injector malfunction, or low-quality diesel.
- Check: Clean air intake, use good-quality fuel, service injectors if needed.

- PTO (Power Take-Off):
- Common Problem: PTO not engaging or stopping late.
- Possible Cause: PTO clutch linkage misadjusted or worn friction plates.
- Check: Adjust linkage or replace friction plate if slipping.

- General Maintenance Tips:
- Change engine oil every 100–150 hours of use.
- Keep radiator clean and free from chaff.
- Grease moving linkages weekly.
- Check tyre pressure before fieldwork.
- Always disengage PTO and turn off the engine before servicing.
