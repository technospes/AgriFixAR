--- Thresher Facts ---
- Model: T-1000
- Function: Separates grain (like wheat, rice, maize, or pulses) from straw and husk.
- Power Source: Typically driven by a tractor via PTO shaft or by a large belt connected to a stationary engine.
- Main Components: Threshing Drum, Feeding Chute, Concave/Grate, Blower Fan, Sieves (Screens), Main Drive Belt, Bearings, and Frame.

- Feeding System:
- Common Problem: Machine gets clogged, rumbling noise from the drum, or sudden stoppage.
- Possible Cause: Feeding too much crop at once, crop material too wet or green, or uneven feeding.
- Check: Stop PTO, remove excess crop manually after engine is off, and ensure crop moisture is below 20%.

- Threshing Drum:
- Function: Separates grain from straw using rotating beaters and concave.
- Common Problem: Excessive vibration or banging sound during operation.
- Possible Cause: Unbalanced drum, broken beaters, or uneven crop feed.
- Common Problem: Straw wraps around drum shaft or rollers.
- Possible Cause: Feeding damp crop or foreign material (plastic twine, grass).
- Check: Clean drum and shaft regularly; never feed foreign materials.

- Drive Belt System:
- Function: Transmits power from tractor PTO or engine to drum, blower, and sieves.
- Common Problem: Drum or blower not spinning, loud squealing noise.
- Possible Cause: Belt is loose, worn, misaligned, or broken.
- Check: Tighten belt, replace if cracked or glazed; align pulleys.

- Blower Fan:
- Function: Blows air to separate chaff from clean grain.
- Common Problem: Clean grain is mixed with straw, husk, or dust.
- Possible Cause: Blower speed too low, belt slipping, or fan blades clogged.
- Check: Adjust blower belt tension; clean fan blades and housing.

- Sieves / Screens:
- Function: Separate clean grain from larger straw pieces and debris.
- Common Problem: Excessive grain loss (grains falling out with straw at the rear).
- Possible Cause: Sieves set too open or clogged with material.
- Common Problem: Clean grain contains too much chaff.
- Possible Cause: Blower speed too low or sieves not properly leveled.
- Check: Clean sieves after every few loads; adjust sieve openings for crop type.

- Bearings & Shaft:
- Function: Allow smooth drum and blower rotation.
- Common Problem: Grinding noise, heat buildup, or vibration.
- Possible Cause: Bearings dry, worn, or misaligned.
- Check: Grease bearings every 8–10 hours of operation; replace if noisy or hot.

- PTO Shaft / Power Transmission:
- Common Problem: PTO shaft vibrates excessively or detaches.
- Possible Cause: Shaft not properly locked or alignment off-center.
- Check: Ensure PTO lock pins are engaged; align tractor straight with thresher.

- Output Grain Quality:
- Common Problem: Grains cracked, broken, or crushed.
- Possible Cause: Drum speed too high or concave clearance too tight.
- Common Problem: Unthreshed grains still in straw.
- Possible Cause: Drum speed too low or crop feeding inconsistent.
- Check: Adjust drum speed (RPM) and concave clearance as per crop.

- Frame & Structural Issues:
- Common Problem: Thresher shakes or vibrates excessively.
- Possible Cause: Loose frame bolts, unbalanced drum, or worn mounts.
- Check: Tighten all bolts before operation; balance rotating parts.

- Safety Problems:
- Common Problem: Injury risk while feeding crop or cleaning machine.
- Safety Note: Always disengage PTO and shut off engine before clearing blockages or performing maintenance.
- Common Problem: Sparks or heat near straw outlet.
- Possible Cause: Metal friction or bearing overheating.
- Check: Clean buildup regularly; stop immediately if unusual noise or smell.

- Electrical / Lighting (if equipped for night operation):
- Common Problem: Indicator lamps or work light not functioning.
- Possible Cause: Damaged wiring or loose connections.
- Check: Inspect connectors and ensure proper insulation.

- General Maintenance Tips:
- Always check and tighten all belts and pulleys before starting.
- Grease bearings and lubrication points regularly.
- Remove leftover straw, chaff, and dust after each use to prevent rust.
- Store the machine under a shed or cover when not in use.
- Periodically check alignment between tractor PTO and thresher shaft.
