--- Motor & Pump Facts ---
- Model: K (Surface and Submersible types)
- Power Supply: Single-phase or three-phase AC (commonly 230V/440V).
- Starting: For small surface motors – pull cord or switch. For submersible motors – electrical starter with capacitor or DOL (Direct-On-Line) panel.

- Pull Cord System: Used in small surface-type irrigation motors.
- Function: Engages flywheel to start the engine using internal recoil spring.
- Common Problem: Cord is jammed, stuck, or won’t pull.
- Possible Cause: Tangled or broken recoil spring, debris around the flywheel, or damaged starter pawl.

- Pump System: Centrifugal (for surface types) or Borewell (for submersible types).
- Function: Lifts water by creating suction using impeller rotation.
- Prime Plug: Located on top of pump housing (surface type).
- Common Problem: Motor runs but no water comes out.
- Possible Cause: Pump has lost prime (air pocket in system), suction pipe leak, or foot valve stuck open.
- Check: Refill water through prime plug; check for leaks and foot valve seal.

- Suction & Delivery Pipe:
- Common Problem: Weak or no water flow even when motor is running.
- Possible Cause: Air leakage in suction pipe joints, blocked suction strainer, or damaged delivery hose.

- Foot Valve (Bottom Non-Return Valve):
- Function: Prevents water from flowing back after motor stops.
- Common Problem: Motor fails to lift water after several attempts.
- Possible Cause: Foot valve stuck open or blocked with sand or leaves.
- Check: Clean valve or replace rubber seat.

- Impeller & Casing:
- Common Problem: Water pressure is low or uneven.
- Possible Cause: Worn or damaged impeller blades, scaling or rust inside casing.
- Check: Inspect impeller for wear; descale and clean casing.

- Air Filter (Surface Engine Motors):
- Function: Cleans air before it enters the carburetor.
- Common Problem: Motor starts but sputters, runs rough, or stalls.
- Possible Cause: Air filter clogged with dust or oil; improper cleaning.
- Check: Remove and clean filter with petrol or replace paper element.

- Spark Plug (for petrol/diesel engine motors):
- Common Problem: Engine is hard to start or doesn’t start (but pull cord works).
- Possible Cause: Plug fouled with carbon, gap incorrect, or wire disconnected.
- Check: Clean spark plug tip, ensure gap is 0.7–0.8mm, reconnect lead.

- Electrical Motor (Submersible type):
- Common Problem: Motor hums but doesn’t rotate.
- Possible Cause: Faulty capacitor, jammed impeller, or low voltage.
- Check: Test capacitor using multimeter, inspect impeller for debris.

- Common Problem: Motor runs for a few seconds then trips off.
- Possible Cause: Overload protection tripping due to high current draw or thermal overload.
- Check: Clean impeller, ensure voltage is stable, inspect control box and overload relay.

- Control Panel:
- Components: Contactor, Overload relay, Capacitor, ON/OFF switches.
- Common Problem: Motor won’t start even when power is on.
- Possible Cause: Burnt contactor, faulty capacitor, or tripped overload relay.
- Check: Reset overload, replace capacitor, inspect wiring connections.

- Wiring & Electrical Supply:
- Common Problem: Motor doesn’t start, gives shock, or trips MCB.
- Possible Cause: Short circuit, insulation damage, or water ingress in connection box.
- Check: Dry motor terminals, use proper earthing, replace damaged cables.

- Bearings:
- Function: Support the rotor shaft and allow smooth spinning.
- Common Problem: Motor makes grinding or squealing noise.
- Possible Cause: Bearings are dry or worn out.
- Check: Lubricate bearings or replace if noisy.

- Seals (Mechanical / Gland Packing):
- Function: Prevents water leakage along the shaft.
- Common Problem: Water leaking from near motor shaft or pump head.
- Possible Cause: Worn mechanical seal or loose gland packing.
- Check: Replace seal or tighten gland nut evenly.

- Overheating:
- Common Problem: Motor body becomes very hot or emits burning smell.
- Possible Cause: Overload, blocked impeller, low voltage, or poor ventilation.
- Check: Ensure motor runs under rated load; clean cooling fins and ventilation holes.

- Noise & Vibration:
- Common Problem: Excessive vibration or rattling sound during operation.
- Possible Cause: Misalignment between motor and pump, loose bolts, or damaged bearings.
- Check: Tighten all bolts, ensure motor-pump alignment, replace bearings if needed.

- Rust & Corrosion (Submersible Type):
- Common Problem: Motor efficiency drops over time or trips frequently.
- Possible Cause: Corrosion on windings or impeller due to prolonged submersion in hard water.
- Check: Use anti-rust coating; periodically remove and service motor.

- Maintenance Tips:
- Always ensure water level is sufficient before running a submersible motor.
- Clean suction strainer weekly.
- Replace capacitor every 1–2 years.
- Never run the pump “dry” (without water) — it will damage seals and windings.
- Ensure proper earthing for safety.
